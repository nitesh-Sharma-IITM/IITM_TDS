JavaScript (5,609 repos), Python (3,783), and Ruby (2,394) are the most common languages. JavaScript and Python being more popular, suggests that resources and support could be tailored toward these languages to reach a larger audience.

Although JavaScript and Python are dominant, there are smaller but still significant communities using languages like Ruby, PHP, and TypeScript.Offer specialized resources, events, or "community spotlights" to these groups to increase engagement in these areas. This could help foster more diverse contributions.
